# Understanding the Express.js Framework
Once an express application has been installed using: 
    
    npx express-generator --view=ejs "MyExpressApp"

The framework will look like the following:

Lets try and explain how everything connects in this folder structure.

# /package.json
If you remember from guide '01. Express.js', to start your express application, you run the command:

    npm start

This command tells npm to look for a script called "start" in the ```package.json``` file.
This script typically looks like the following:

![](/00.%20Images/03.%20Decentralised%20Apps/package.json.JPG)

This means when ```npm start``` is run, it executes the script ```/bin/www``` first. 

## /bin/www

An 'Application Entry Point' refers to the starting point of your application.
In a node.js / express.js application, this starting point is ```/bin/www```.

After setting up some initial configurations, the www script loads the main application logic from the ```app.js``` file. ```app.js``` is a common name for the main entry file of an Express.js application. It's where you configure your Express app, set up middleware, define routes, and perform other application-specific configurations.

__The very first thing this script does is ```require()``` the "real" application entry point (app.js, in the project root) that sets up and returns the ```express()``` application object.__

- _The ```express()``` function is a top-level function that creates an express app_

## /app.js

This file creates an express application object (named app, by convention), sets up the application with various settings and middleware, and then exports the app from the module.

``` Javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
// â€¦
module.exports = app;
```

Back in the www entry point file above, it is this module.exports object that is supplied to the caller when this file is imported.

---

The ```app.js``` file creates the app object using the imported express module, and then uses it to set up the view (template) engine. 
- _A view is just a basic 'template' for a HTML page_

There are two parts to setting up the engine. First, we set the 'views' value to specify the folder where the templates will be stored (in this case the subfolder /views). Then we set the 'view engine' value to specify the template library (in this case "pug").

## /routes
The route file ```/routes/users.js``` (shares a a similar structureas ```index.js```). First, it loads the express module and uses it to get an ```express.Router``` object. Then it specifies a route on that object and lastly exports the router from the module (this is what allows the file to be imported into ```app.js```).

- The route defines a callback that will be invoked whenever an HTTP ```GET``` request with the correct pattern is detected. In other words, this route will be used when a URL of ```/users/``` is received.
