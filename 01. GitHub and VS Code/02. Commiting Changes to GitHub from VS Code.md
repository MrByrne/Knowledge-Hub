# Saving Changes in a Git Repository

Once you are working in your repository, any new changes or updates will need to be saved.

## Locally

To save changes locally, use `Ctrl+S`.

- If you see a dot beside your file name, it means that this document is unsaved:

## To Save Changes to GitHub:

1. **Stage Changes:**
   - In Git, staging a change means preparing a modification to be included in the next commit.
   - Anytime you update a file in VS Code, it will appear under the source control tab - 'Changes':

   - Hover over the changed file and select the plus symbol.
   - This "stages" your file to be "committed" to the repository.

   - You will now see that it has been moved to a new section called 'Staged Changes'.

2. **Add Comment:**
   - Once you have moved all the files you are ready to commit into this section, add a brief comment.
   - This comment should explain what changes have been made.
