## How do I link this to VS Code?

- VS Code interacts with GitHub through a VS Code extension called: GitHub Pull Requests and Issues
- It uses a language called Git - you will need to install this.
  - To check that Git has installed correctly, you can check this in your command prompt
  - Type CMD into your windows search bar
  - This will open the command prompt dialogue box
  - Here, type "git --version" to check the version of Git you have installed.

- Next, to download the GitHub Pull Requests and Issues extension, first open VS Code.
- Navigate to the extensions tab:

## Cloning a Repository

When you clone a repository from GitHub, you create a local copy on your machine. After making changes to the code in your local copy, the local repository is automatically updated with those changes. However, these changes are only reflected in your local copy; the remote repository on GitHub remains unchanged until you explicitly push the changes.

- In VS code - use the Git: Clone command (Ctrl+Shift+P)
  Or
- Use the 'Clone Repository' Button under the Source Control Tab

This will prompt the below 'Clone from Github' popup.

Select this, and your GitHub repositories will appear.

Once you select your repository, you will be prompted to choose a folder location locally where a copy of the repository will be stored.
You will then be asked to open the repository - select yes.
