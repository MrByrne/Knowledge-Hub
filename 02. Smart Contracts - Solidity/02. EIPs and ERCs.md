# ERCs and EIPs

## What is an Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC)?
- A label given to some EIPs that attempt to define a specific standard of Ethereum usage - reference

## What is an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)?
- A design document providing information to the Ethereum community, describing a proposed new feature or its processes or environment - reference
- EIPs contain technical specifications for the proposed changes and act as the “source of truth” for the community. Network upgrades and application standards for Ethereum are discussed and developed through the EIP process.

## Why do we need EIPs?
- EIPs play a central role in how changes happen and are documented on Ethereum. They are the way for people to propose, debate, and adopt changes. There are different types of EIPs, including core EIPs for low-level protocol changes that affect consensus and require a network upgrade like EIP-1559, and ERCs for application standards like EIP-20 and EIP-721.
