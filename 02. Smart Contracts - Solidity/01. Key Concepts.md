Web 1 - Static Content i.e. static images and text  
Web 2 - Dynamic Content on centralized servers  
Web 3 - Dynamic content on decentralized platforms

Smart Contracts create 'Trust Minimized Agreements' (unbreakable promises)

**Hash:** A unique, fixed-length string, meant to identify a piece of data. They are created by placing said data into a hash function.

The SHA 265 Hash value is created by putting the block number, Nonce, previous hash number, and the data in the block into a hashing algorithm. When miners are mining, they are trying to find a nonce that will result in a hash value with the correct number of leading zeros.

ETH transaction fee (Gas) is partly given to miners, and the remainder is burned (removed from circulation). The Gas fee is determined by demand on the blockchain. There is a limited amount of space inside each block. Therefore, the more demand, the higher the fee to be included.

Bits and Bytes are used to measure computer data. A bit is the smallest form of computer data. It is either a '1' or a '0'. 

- 1 Byte = 8 bits
- A single alphabet character/symbol/number requires 1 Byte to be expressed. For example:
  - 'T' = 01010100
  - 'Q' = 01010001

Kilobyte, Megabyte, Gigabyte are all used to represent large pieces of data that require many bytes.

Bits are used for internet speed, and Bytes are used for data storage.

**Function Visibility Specifiers**

1. **Public:** Visible externally and internally.
   - Anyone who interacts with the contract can see the 'public variable'
2. **Private:** Only visible in the current contract.
3. **External:** Only visible externally (only for functions).
4. **Internal:** Only visible internally.
   - The variable can only be called by the owning contract and its child contracts.

**Contract Costs**

The more a contract does or stores, the more expensive the gas fees will be.

---

**Solidity Tricks**

There are two functions that can be used in a smart contract that don't require Gas Fees to interact with:

1. **View**
   - Reading something from the contract.
   - A view function disallows any modification of the state of the contract.
2. **Pure**
   - It can only use local variables that are declared in the function and the arguments that are passed to the function to compute or return a value.
   - A view function disallows any modification of the state of the contract.
   - A pure function disallows you from reading from the blockchain/contract.

We only spend gas if we modify the blockchain state.
